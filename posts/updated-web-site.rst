Perhaps youâ€™ve noticed that the Gallant lab web site has not been updated for
the last couple of years. The old site was always unwieldy to manage, and after
our last system upgrade it became practically impossible. So a complete refactor
was overdue. The new site is based on the
`Nikola static site framework <https://getnikola.com>`_,
and it is hosted on github pages. I expect that the new site will be much easier
to update and maintain than was the old one. As part of the site redesign, we have
added two important new pages:

- The `Open Data page <https://gallantlab.org/open_data/index.html>`_ provides
  direct links to the data sets that we have released to date. We will try to
  maintain canonical links to all our data through this page.
- The `Open Code page <https://gallantlab.org/open_code/index.html>`_ provides
  direct links to the open code that we have released on github.
- Nikola also includes the capacity to host a blog, with provision for jupyter
  notebooks, code and the like. Its
  my hope that the blog will become a great resource for the cognitive neuroscience
  community.
