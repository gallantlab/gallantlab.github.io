<img src="{{ "/assets/img/papers/ViscontiDoC.2025.webp" | relative_url }}" alt="Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al. 2025" style="width: 60px; height: auto; max-height: 80px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 4px; float: left; margin-right: 10px;"> Here is an amazing new paper on individual differences from Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al.
