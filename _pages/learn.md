    remaining_description: "Voxelwise modeling is a framework for fitting encoding models to fMRI data. Voxelwise modeling is currently the most sensitive and powerful framework available for modeling fMRI data. It can be used to fit dozens of distinct models simultaneously, each model having up to several thousand distinct features. Voxelwise modeling also conforms to all best practices in data science, which maximizes sensitivity, reliability and generalizability of the resulting models. We are providing these online tutorials here as a service to the fMRI community."
