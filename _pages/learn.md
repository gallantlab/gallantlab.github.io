    remaining_description: "The Voxelwise Encoding Model (VEM) framework is a framework for fitting encoding models to fMRI data. This framework is currently the most sensitive and powerful approach available for modeling fMRI data. It can be used to fit dozens of distinct models simultaneously, each model having up to several thousand distinct features. The Voxelwise Encoding Model framework also conforms to all best practices in data science, which maximizes sensitivity, reliability and generalizability of the resulting models. We are providing these online tutorials here as a service to the fMRI community."
