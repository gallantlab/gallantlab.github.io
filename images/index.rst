    - `Semantic representations during language production are affected by
      context (Deniz et al., J. Neuroscience, 2023). 
      <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.15.472839.full.pdf>`_
      Context is an important part of understanding the meaning of natural 
      language, but most neuroimaging studies of meaning use isolated words 
      and isolated sentences with little context. In this study we examined 
      whether the results of neuroimaging language studies that use 
      out-of-context stimuli generalize to natural language. We find that 
      increasing context improves the quality of neuroimaging data and
      changes where and how semantic information is represented in the brain. 
      These results suggest that findings from studies using out-of-context 
      stimuli may not generalize to natural language used in daily life.
