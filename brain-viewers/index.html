To determine how semantic representations in the brains of bilinguals can support both shared and distinct processing for different languages, we performed fMRI scans of participants who are fluent in both English and Chinese while they read natural narratives in each language. This brain viewer allows you to explore, compare and contrast English and Chinese semantic representations in one bilingual participant.</div></div></div><div class="publication-card card fade-in"><div class=publication-image><a href=https://gallantlab.org/viewer-chen-2024/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src=/img/papers/Chen.etal.2024.webp alt="Chen 2024" loading=lazy></a></div><div class=publication-info><h3 class=publication-title><a href=https://gallantlab.org/viewer-chen-2024/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">The cortical representation of language timescales is shared between reading and listening (Chen et al., Communications Biology, 2024)</a></h3><div class=publication-description>Language comprehension involves integrating low-level sensory inputs into a hierarchy of increasingly high-level features. To recover this hierarchy we mapped the intrinsic timescale of language representation across the cerebral cortex during listening and reading. We find that the timescale of representation is organized similarly for the two modalities. The interactive brain viewer shows how the timescales of language representation change systematically across the cortical surface. The colors on the cortical map indicate the context length for language representation.</div></div></div><div class="publication-card card fade-in"><div class=publication-image><a href=https://gallantlab.org/viewer-deniz-2019/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src=/img/papers/Deniz.F.2019.webp alt="Deniz 2019" loading=lazy></a></div><div class=publication-info><h3 class=publication-title><a href=https://gallantlab.org/viewer-deniz-2019/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">The representation of semantic information across human cerebral cortex during listening versus reading is invariant to stimulus modality (Deniz et al., J.

Voxelwise modeling was used to determine how each individual brain location responded to semantic concepts in the stories during listening and reading, separately.

Voxelwise modeling was used to determine how each brain location responded to 985 distinct categories of objects and actions in the movies, and how these responses were modulated by attention. This brain viewer allows you to view data collected under the three different conditions (left click "Passive Viewing", "Attending to Humans" or "Attending to Vehicles"). By selecting single brain locations (left click on the brain) or single categories (left click on the WordNet tree), you can see how tuning changes under different states of attention.</div></div></div><div class="publication-card card fade-in"><div class=publication-image><a href=https://gallantlab.org/viewer-stories-group/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src=/img/papers/Huth.A.2016.webp alt="Group semantic maps" loading=lazy></a></div><div class=publication-info><h3 class=publication-title><a href=https://gallantlab.org/viewer-stories-group/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Group-based language comprehension semantic map viewer</a></h3><div class=publication-description>In 2016 we <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4852309/>published a paper</a> that used fMRI, a language comprehension experiment, and voxelwise encoding models to map lexical semantic concepts across the cortical surface. We released brain viewer for that study (see above on this page), but that viewer only showed data from one participant. This viewer provides a way to inspect cortical lexical-semantic conceptual maps at the group level, vertex-by-vertex. The data for this viewer were generated by pooling lexical semantic maps from 24 separate participants who listened to several hours of natural narrative stories. Based on the results that we reported in <a href=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.22.671848v1>another recent paper</a>, this viewer should account for about 80% of the variance in lexical semantic conceptual maps in any individual. <em>Please note that although this viewer is usable, it is still in development.

However, it can be difficult to orient oneself correctly when inspecting these maps. This viewer provides labels for many of the most commonly referenced sulci and gyri. By switching between folded, inflated and flattened views one can get a good sense of how important cortical landmarks vary across these different views.</div></div></div><div class="publication-card card fade-in"><div class=publication-image><a href=https://gallantlab.org/viewer-retinotopy-demo/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src=/img/other/retinotopy.webp alt=Retinotopy loading=lazy></a></div><div class=publication-info><h3 class=publication-title><a href=https://gallantlab.org/viewer-retinotopy-demo/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Retinotopy viewer</a></h3><div class=publication-description>The human brain contains many different retinotopic maps, and these maps are one of the primary tools used to parcellate the visual system. Given the large number of maps and their complicated spatial relationships to one another, it is often difficult for students to fully understand how the maps are related. This viewer shows real-time functional activity evoked in a retinal mapping experiment. By identifying the angular and eccentricity functional maps one can gain a good understanding of retinotopic organization.</div></div></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-center"><div class="f6 fw4 white-70 tc pv2 ph3">&copy; Copyright 2026 Jack Gallant.
