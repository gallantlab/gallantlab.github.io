This site provides information about ongoing research in Jack Gallant's cognitive, systems and computational neuroscience lab at UC Berkeley. Here you can find our cool interactive brain viewers, some of our published papers, information about the great people who do the work, our open data, open source code, and tutorials.

If you would like to know more about the general philosophy of the lab, please listen to this [Freakonomics podcast interview with Jack Gallant](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/this-is-your-brain-on-podcasts/) or to these OHBM discussions between Peter Bandettini and Jack Gallant ([discussion 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKmGF3REyuA&list=PLEJ899jsgdRoMWrUhwBsP7-R_DsfIkRFk&index=5), [discussion 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skX7tzWxwFk)). If you would like to know more about our cutting-edge fMRI data analysis and modeling framework, voxelwise encoding models, check this recent [tutorial](https://github.com/gallantlab/voxelwise_tutorials).

## We are recruiting postdocs!

We currently have openings for potential postdocs. If you are interested please contact [Jack Gallant](/people/).
