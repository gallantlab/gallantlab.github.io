## Learn About Voxelwise Encoding Models

{{< content-card title="Voxelwise Encoding Model review paper" url="https://www.psyarxiv.com/nt2jq" image="/img/papers/ViscontidOC.Deniz.2025.webp" alt="Voxelwise Encoding Model guide" description="This review paper provides the first comprehensive guide to the Voxelwise Encoding Model (VEM) framework. The VEM framework is a framework for fitting encoding models to fMRI data. This framework is currently the most sensitive and powerful approach available for modeling fMRI data. It can be used to fit dozens of distinct models simultaneously, each model having up to several thousand distinct features. The Voxelwise Encoding Model framework also conforms to all best practices in data science, which maximizes sensitivity, reliability and generalizability of the resulting models." >}}

This paper (Dupré la Tour et al., Neuroimage, 2022) describes how banded ridge regression can be used to solve these problems. Furthermore, several methods are proposed to address the computational challenge of fitting banded ridge regressions on large numbers of voxels and feature spaces. All implementations are released in an open-source Python package called Himalaya." >}}
