first_sentence: 'We''ve released <a href="https://github.com/gallantlab/autoflatten">Autoflatten</a>, a Python pipeline for automatically flattening cortical surfaces generated by FreeSurfer.'
remaining_description: "Prior to the development of this pipeline flattening was done largely by hand, an incredibly time-consuming and frustrating process. This new pipeline automates most of the work. Thanks to <a href='/people#matteo-visconti-di-oleggio-castello-phd'>Dr. Matteo Visconti di Oleggio Castello</a> for this great new tool!"
