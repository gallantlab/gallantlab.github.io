first_sentence: 'Our awesome postdoc <a href="/people#tianjiao-zhang-phd">Dr. Tianjiao Zhang</a> has uploaded his Naturalistic Navigation study as a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2025.12.16.694742v1">preprint on bioRxiv</a>.'
remaining_description: "Participants performed a taxi driver task in a large virtual world. Voxelwise encoding models were used to fit 38 different feature spaces (comprising an astounding 28,134 distinct features) to the data. Results show that naturalistic navigation is supported by a network of 11 functionally distinct cortical regions that operate together to transform perceptual inputs through decision-making processes to produce action outputs. This paper really pushes the boundaries of what is possible in fMRI, no one has ever done anything at this scale before."
