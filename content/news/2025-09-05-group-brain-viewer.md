first_sentence: 'We''ve created a new <a href="https://gallantlab.org/viewer-stories-group/">brain viewer</a> that provides a way to inspect cortical lexical-semantic conceptual maps at the group level, vertex-by-vertex.'
remaining_description: 'The data for this viewer were generated by pooling lexical semantic maps from 24 separate participants who listened to several hours of natural narrative stories. Based on the results that we reported in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.22.671848v1">another recent paper</a>, this viewer should account for about 80% of the variance in lexical semantic conceptual maps in any individual.'
