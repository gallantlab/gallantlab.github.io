Welcome to the official Gallant Lab blog! This is a space where we'll share longer-form articles about our research, insights into cognitive neuroscience, and updates from our lab at UC Berkeley.

## What to Expect

In this blog, you'll find:

- **Deep dives into our research**: Detailed explanations of our latest findings and methodologies
- **Behind-the-scenes looks**: How we design experiments and analyze complex fMRI data
- **Perspectives on neuroscience**: Thoughts on the field of cognitive, systems and computational neuroscience
- **Lab life**: Stories from our team members and their research journeys

## Our Research Focus

The Gallant Lab focuses on understanding how the human brain represents complex information during natural tasks. We use cutting-edge fMRI techniques and computational modeling to map semantic representations, visual processing, and language comprehension across the cerebral cortex.

Our work has revealed intricate semantic maps that tile the human cortex, showing how different concepts and categories are organized in the brain. We're particularly interested in how these representations remain consistent across different sensory modalities and individuals.
