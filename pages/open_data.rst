      who were listening to or reading narrative stories.

      These data were collected as part of our 2023 study of context
      effects on semantic representation
      (`Semantic representations during language production are affected by
      context, Deniz et al., J. Neuroscience, 2023

      of short video clips.

      These data were collected as part of our 2016 study on semantic maps

      They were also used in our 2021 study of the alignment
      of semantic selectivity along the anterior border of visual cortex
      (`Visual and linguistic semantic representations are aligned at the
      border of human visual cortex, Popham et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2021

      These data were collected as part of our 2021 study of state spaces
