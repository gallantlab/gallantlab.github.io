         Semantic representations during language production are affected by context 
         (Deniz et al., J. Neuroscience, 2023)</a>. Context is an important part of 
         understanding the meaning of natural language, but most neuroimaging studies 
         of meaning use isolated words and isolated sentences with little context. In 
         this study, we examined whether the results of neuroimaging language studies 
         that use out-of-context stimuli generalize to natural language. We find that 
         increasing context improves the quality of neuroimaging data and changes where 
         and how semantic information is represented in the brain. These results suggest 
         that findings from studies using out-of-context stimuli may not generalize to 
         natural language used in daily life.

        Feature-space selection with banded ridge regression 
        (Dupre la Tour et al., Neuroimage, 2022)</a>.
        Encoding models identify the information represented in brain 
        recordings, but fitting multiple models simultaneously presents 
        several challenges. This paper describes how banded ridge regression 
        can be used to solve these problems. Furthermore, several methods are 
        proposed to address the computational challenge of fitting banded 
        ridge regressions on large numbers of voxels and feature spaces. All 
        implementations are released in an open-source Python package called 
        Himalaya.

        Visual and linguistic semantic representations are aligned at the
        border of human visual cortex (Popham et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2021)</a><p>.
        The human brain contains functionally and anatomically distinct networks
        for representing semantic information in each sensory modality, and a
        separate, distributed amodal conceptual network. In this study we
        examined the spatial organization of visual and amodal semantic
        functional maps. The pattern of semantic selectivity in these two
        distinct networks corresponds along the boundary of visual cortex:
        for visual categories represented posterior to the boundary, the
        same categories are represented linguistically on the anterior side.
        These results suggest that these two networks are smoothly joined
        to form one contiguous map.</p>

        Voxel-based state space modeling recovers task-related cognitive states in
        naturalistic fMRI experiments (Zhang et al., Front. Neuro., 2021)</a>.
        Complex natural tasks recruit many different functional brain networks,
        and we understand little about how such tasks qre represented in the brain.
        Here we present a voxel-based state space modeling method for recovering
        task-related state spaces from human fMRI data. We apply this method to
        data acquired in a controlled visual attention task and a video game task.
        We show that each task induces distinct brain states that can be embedded
        in a low-dimensional state space that reflects task parameters, and that
        attention increases state separation in the task-related subspace.

        Design of complex neuroscience experiments using mixed-integer linear programming
        (Slivkoff and Gallant, Neuron, 2021)</a>.
        This tutorial and primer reviews how mixed integer linear
        programming can be used to optimize the design of complex
        experiments using many different variables. The approach is
        particularly useful when designing complex fMRI experiments
        --such as question answering studies--that aim to manipulat
        and probe many dimensions simultaneously.

        The representation of semantic information across human cerebral cortex
        during listening versus reading is invariant to stimulus modality
        (Deniz et al., J. Neurosci., 2019)</a>.
        Humans can comprehend the meaning of words from both spoken and written
        language. It is therefore important to understand the relationship between
        the brain representations of spoken or written text. Here, we show that
        although the representation of semantic information in the human brain is
        quite complex, the semantic representations evoked by listening versus
        reading are almost identical. These results suggest that the representation
        of language semantics is independent of the sensory modality through which
        the semantic information is received.

        Human scene-selective areas represent 3D configurations of surfaces
        (Lescroart et al., Neuron, 2019)</a>.
        It has been argued that scene-selective areas in the
        human brain represent both the 3D structure of the
        local visual environment and low-level 2D features 
        that provide cues for 3D structure. To evaluate these
        hypotheses we developed an encoding model of 3D scene
        structure and tested it against a model of low-
        level 2D features. We fit the models to fMRI data
        recorded while subjects viewed visual scenes. Scene-
        selective areas represent the distance to and orientation
        of large surfaces. The most important dimensions of 3D 
        structure are distance and openness.

        Natural speech reveals the semantic maps that tile human cerebral
        cortex (Huth et al., Nature, 2016)</a>.
        As of 2016 (when this paper appeared) little of the human 
        lexical-semantic system had been mapped comprehensively, and the
        semantic selectivity of most regions was unknown. We collected 
        fMRI while subjects listened to narrative stories, and
        recovered lexical-semantic maps by voxelwise modeling. We
        showed that the semantic system is organized into intricate patterns
        that seem to be consistent across individuals. We then used a generative
        model to create a detailed semantic atlas. Our results show that most
        areas within the semantic system represent information about groups
        of related concepts, and the atlas shows which concepts are represented
        in each area.
