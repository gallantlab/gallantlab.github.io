    - `Semantic representations during language production are affected by
      context 
      (Deniz et al., J. Neuroscience, 2023
      <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.15.472839.full.pdf>`_).
      Context is an important part of understanding the meaning of natural 
      language, but most neuroimaging studies of meaning use isolated words 
      and isolated sentences with little context. In this study we examined 
      whether the results of neuroimaging language studies that use 
      out-of-context stimuli generalize to natural language. We find that 
      increasing context improves the quality of neuroimaging data and
      changes where and how semantic information is represented in the brain. 
      These results suggest that findings from studies using out-of-context 
      stimuli may not generalize to natural language used in daily life.

    - `Feature-space selection with banded ridge regression 
      (Dupre la Tour et al., Neuroimage, 2022
      <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811922008497>`_).
      Encoding models identify the information represented in brain 
      recordings, but fitting multiple models simultaneously presents 
      several challenges. This paper describes how banded ridge regression 
      can be used to solve these problems. Furthermore, several methods are 
      proposed to address the computational challenge of fitting banded 
      ridge regressions on large numbers of voxels and feature spaces. All 
      implementations are released in an open-source Python package called 
      Himalaya.

    - `Visual and linguistic semantic representations are aligned at the
      border of human visual cortex
      (Popham et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2021
      <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_CcPfViYAUQFD2HxdneEzSrmBwjd-QkJ/view>`_).
      The human brain contains functionally and anatomically distinct networks
      for representing semantic information in each sensory modality, and a
      separate, distributed amodal conceptual network. In this study we
      examined the spatial organization of visual and amodal semantic
      functional maps. The pattern of semantic selectivity in these two
      distinct networks corresponds along the boundary of visual cortex:
      for visual categories represented posterior to the boundary, the
      same categories are represented linguistically on the anterior side.
      These results suggest that these two networks are smoothly joined
      to form one contiguous map.

    - `Voxel-based state space modeling recovers task-related
      cognitive states in naturalistic fMRI experiments
      (Zhang et al., Front. Neuro., 2021
      <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.565976/full>`_).
      As of 2016 
      Complex natural tasks recruit many different functional brain networks,
      and we understand little about how such tasks qre represented in the brain.
      Here we present a voxel-based state space modeling method for recovering
      task-related state spaces from human fMRI data. We apply this method to
      data acquired in a controlled visual attention task and a video game task.
      We show that each task induces distinct brain states that can be embedded
      in a low-dimensional state space that reflects task parameters, and that
      attention increases state separation in the task-related subspace.

    - `Design of complex neuroscience experiments
      using mixed-integer linear programming
      (Slivkoff and Gallant, Neuron, 2021
      <https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(21)00119-7.pdf>`_).
      This tutorial and primer reviews how mixed integer linear
      programming can be used to optimize the design of complex
      experiments using many different variables. The approach is
      particularly useful when designing complex fMRI experiments
      --such as question answering studies--that aim to manipulat
      and probe many dimensions simultaneously.

    - `The representation of semantic information across human cerebral cortex
      during listening versus reading is invariant to stimulus modality
      (Deniz et al., J. Neurosci., 2019
      <https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/39/7722>`_).
      Humans can comprehend the meaning of words from both spoken and written
      language. It is therefore important to understand the relationship between
      the brain representations of spoken or written text. Here, we show that
      although the representation of semantic information in the human brain is
      quite complex, the semantic representations evoked by listening versus
      reading are almost identical. These results suggest that the representation
      of language semantics is independent of the sensory modality through which
      the semantic information is received.

    - `Human scene-selective areas represent 3D configurations of surfaces
      (Lesroart et al., Neuron, 2019
      <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4852309/>`_).
      It has been argued that scene-selective areas in the
      human brain represent both the 3D structure of the
      local visual environment and low-level 2D features 
      that provide cues for 3D structure. To evaluate these
      hypotheses we developed an encoding model of 3D scene
      structure and tested it against a model of low-
      level 2D features. We fit the models to fMRI data
      recorded while subjects viewed visual scenes. Scene-
      selective areas represent the distance to and orientation
      of large surfaces. The most important dimensions of 3D 
      structure are distance and openness.

    - `Natural speech reveals the semantic maps that tile the
      human cerebral cortex
      (Huth et al., Nature, 2016
      <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4852309/>`_).
      As of 2016 (when this paper appeared) little of the human 
      lexical-semantic system had been mapped comprehensively, and the
      semantic selectivity of most regions was unknown. We collected 
      fMRI while subjects listened to narrative stories, and
      recovered lexical-semantic maps by voxelwise modeling. We
      showed that the semantic system is organized into intricate patterns
      that seem to be consistent across individuals. We then used a generative
      model to create a detailed semantic atlas. Our results show that most
      areas within the semantic system represent information about groups
      of related concepts, and the atlas shows which concepts are represented
      in each area.
