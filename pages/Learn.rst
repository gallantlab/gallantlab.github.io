      Voxelwise modeling is a framework for fitting linear(ized)
      encoding models to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      datasets. Voxelwise modeling can produce high-resolution,
      high-dimensional functional brain maps in single individuals,
      while minimizing problems due to Type 1 and Type 2 error that are
      common in other approaches to fMRI data analysis.
