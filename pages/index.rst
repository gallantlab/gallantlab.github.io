This site provides information about ongoing research in our lab, the great
people who do the work, our open data, and our open source code. The blog
presents opinions by the PI and lab staff.

          Semantic representations during language production are affected by
          context (Deniz et al., J. Neuroscience, 2023).</a>
          Context is important for understanding the meaning of natural 
          language, but most neuroimaging language studies use isolated words 
          and sentences with little context. This study investigates whether
          the results of studies that use out-of-context stimuli generalize to 
          natural language. We find that increasing context improves the 
          quality of neuroimaging data, and that it changes the representation
          of semantic information in the brain. These results suggest that  
          findings from studies using out-of-context stimuli may not generalize 
          to natural language used in daily life.

          Feature-space selection with banded ridge regression 
          (Dupre la Tour et al., Neuroimage, 2022).</a>
          Encoding models identify the information represented in brain 
          recordings, but fitting multiple models simultaneously presents 
          several challenges. This paper describes how banded ridge regression 
          can be used to solve these problems. Furthermore, several methods are 
          proposed to address the computational challenge of fitting banded 
          ridge regressions on large numbers of voxels and feature spaces. All 
          implementations are released in an open-source Python package called 
          Himalaya.

          Visual and linguistic semantic representations are aligned at the 
          border of human visual cortex (Popham et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2021).</a>
          The human brain contains functionally and anatomically distinct networks
          for representing semantic information in each sensory modality, and a
          separate, distributed amodal conceptual network. In this study we 
          examined the spatial organization of visual and amodal semantic 
          functional maps. The pattern of semantic selectivity in these two 
          distinct networks corresponds along the boundary of visual cortex: 
          for visual categories represented posterior to the boundary, the 
          same categories are represented linguistically on the anterior side.
          These results suggest that these two networks are smoothly joined 
          to form one contiguous map.
