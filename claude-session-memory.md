### Development Process

1. **Website Research**: Used Task agent to systematically search for lab websites of 6 professors
2. **YAML Syntax Fix**: Resolved quote escaping issues in HTML links within YAML descriptions
3. **Image Processing**: Used ImageMagick to convert JPG to WebP format
4. **Local Development**: Started Jekyll server with LiveReload for real-time testing

## Current Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-27 (Fourth Session)
**Working Directory**: `/Users/gallant/LABADMIN/WEB/JEKYLL.7-25/working-gallant-site`

### Major Changes Made

1. **Sunjae Shim Profile Image Updated**: Complete image processing workflow
   - **Original Image**: `Sunjae.Shim.JPG` (7728x5152 pixels)
   - **Cropped to Portrait**: Used ImageMagick to crop to 1:1.5 aspect ratio (3435x5152 pixels) keeping face centered
   - **Converted to WebP**: `assets/img/people/Sunjae.Shim.webp` for web optimization
   - **Image Display Issue Resolved**: Initially not showing due to browser cache, resolved after browser refresh

### Development Process

1. **Image Processing Pipeline**:

   - `magick "Sunjae.Shim.JPG" -gravity center -crop 3435x5152+0+0 "Sunjae.Shim.cropped.jpg"`
   - `magick "Sunjae.Shim.cropped.jpg" "Sunjae.Shim.webp"`
   - `mv "Sunjae.Shim.webp" "assets/img/people/"`

2. **Jekyll Server Management**:

   - Restarted Jekyll server multiple times to troubleshoot image display
   - Used clean rebuild (`bundle exec jekyll clean`) to force asset regeneration
   - Confirmed image appears in generated HTML at `_site/people/index.html`

3. **Git Workflow**:
   - Ran `npx prettier --write .` (all files unchanged, formatting already correct)
   - Added all changes to staging area
   - Created descriptive commit message with proper formatting
   - Successfully pushed to GitHub Pages for deployment

### Technical Details

- **Aspect Ratio Calculation**: For 1:1.5 portrait, width = height/1.5, so 5152/1.5 ≈ 3435 pixels wide
- **ImageMagick Configuration**: Jekyll plugin only processes .jpg/.jpeg by default, but .webp files work directly
- **Jekyll Image Processing**: The imagemagick plugin generates responsive versions (480px, 800px, 1400px) but original .webp files are used as-is
- **Browser Cache Issue**: Image didn't appear initially due to browser caching, resolved with hard refresh

### Files Modified/Added

- `assets/img/people/Sunjae.Shim.webp` - New processed profile image (1:1.5 aspect ratio)
- `Sunjae.Shim.JPG` - Original source image (committed for reference)
- `Sunjae.Shim.cropped.jpg` - Intermediate cropped version (committed for reference)
- `assets/img/people/Mark.Lescroart.webp` - Previously processed, now committed
- `claude-session-memory.md` - Session documentation updated

### Current Status

- ✅ **Image Processing Complete**: Sunjae Shim image cropped to 1:1.5 aspect ratio and converted to WebP
- ✅ **Local Testing Successful**: Image displays correctly on people page at http://localhost:4000
- ✅ **Code Quality Check**: Prettier formatting passed (no changes needed)
- ✅ **Git Commit Created**: Descriptive commit with proper co-authorship attribution
- ✅ **Deployment Pushed**: Changes pushed to GitHub Pages (commit b11068d5)

### Last Commit Details

```
b11068d5 - Update Sunjae Shim profile image with proper aspect ratio
- Crop Sunjae.Shim.JPG to 1:1.5 portrait aspect ratio keeping face centered
- Convert to WebP format and place in assets/img/people/
- Update existing profile data in _data/people.yml
- Add Mark Lescroart WebP profile image to assets
```

### Development Commands Used

- `magick` commands for cropping and format conversion
- `pkill -f jekyll` and `bundle exec jekyll serve` - Server management
- `touch _pages/people.md` - Force page regeneration
- `npx prettier --write .` - Code formatting
- `git add . && git commit && git push` - Version control workflow

### Next Session Priorities

- Monitor GitHub Pages deployment (should be live within minutes)
