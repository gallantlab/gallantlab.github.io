## Current Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-27 (Fourth Session)
**Working Directory**: `/Users/gallant/LABADMIN/WEB/JEKYLL.7-25/working-gallant-site`

### Major Changes Made

1. **Sunjae Shim Profile Image Updated**: Complete image processing workflow
   - **Original Image**: `Sunjae.Shim.JPG` (7728x5152 pixels)
   - **Cropped to Portrait**: Used ImageMagick to crop to 1:1.5 aspect ratio (3435x5152 pixels) keeping face centered
   - **Converted to WebP**: `assets/img/people/Sunjae.Shim.webp` for web optimization
   - **Image Display Issue Resolved**: Initially not showing due to browser cache, resolved after browser refresh

### Development Process

1. **Image Processing Pipeline**:

   - `magick "Sunjae.Shim.JPG" -gravity center -crop 3435x5152+0+0 "Sunjae.Shim.cropped.jpg"`
   - `magick "Sunjae.Shim.cropped.jpg" "Sunjae.Shim.webp"`
   - `mv "Sunjae.Shim.webp" "assets/img/people/"`

2. **Jekyll Server Management**:

   - Restarted Jekyll server multiple times to troubleshoot image display
   - Used clean rebuild (`bundle exec jekyll clean`) to force asset regeneration
   - Confirmed image appears in generated HTML at `_site/people/index.html`

3. **Git Workflow**:
   - Ran `npx prettier --write .` (all files unchanged, formatting already correct)
   - Added all changes to staging area
   - Created descriptive commit message with proper formatting
   - Successfully pushed to GitHub Pages for deployment

### Technical Details

- **Aspect Ratio Calculation**: For 1:1.5 portrait, width = height/1.5, so 5152/1.5 ≈ 3435 pixels wide
- **ImageMagick Configuration**: Jekyll plugin only processes .jpg/.jpeg by default, but .webp files work directly
- **Jekyll Image Processing**: The imagemagick plugin generates responsive versions (480px, 800px, 1400px) but original .webp files are used as-is
- **Browser Cache Issue**: Image didn't appear initially due to browser caching, resolved with hard refresh

### Files Modified/Added

- `assets/img/people/Sunjae.Shim.webp` - New processed profile image (1:1.5 aspect ratio)
- `Sunjae.Shim.JPG` - Original source image (committed for reference)
- `Sunjae.Shim.cropped.jpg` - Intermediate cropped version (committed for reference)

## Current Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-29 (Seventh Session - Major Jekyll Overhaul)
**Working Directory**: `/Users/gallant/LABLADMIN/WEB/JEKYLL.7-25/working-gallant-site`

### Major Architectural Changes Made

This session involved a comprehensive overhaul of the entire website to implement Jekyll best practices and create a unified "bold first sentence" system across all content sections.

### 1. **Bold First Sentence System Implementation** - Jekyll Compliant

**Problem**: User wanted to bold the first sentence in all content blurbs across the site (news, publications, brain viewers, tutorials, code, data)

**Solution**: Implemented structured YAML approach with two patterns:

- `first_sentence` + `remaining_description` for regular text
- `first_sentence_with_link: true` for items where the title/link should be the bold first sentence

**Implementation**:

- Added `.first-sentence { font-weight: bold; }` CSS class
- Updated all content sections to use structured data instead of hardcoded HTML
- Applied consistently across: news, publications, brain viewers, tutorials, code, data

### 2. **Template Architecture Overhaul** - Jekyll Best Practices

**Created Unified Template System**:

- `_layouts/news.liquid` - Dedicated layout for news items with chronological sorting
- `_layouts/publications.liquid` - Enhanced to handle both publications and general content
- `_layouts/content_list.liquid` - Unified template for brain viewers, tutorials, code, data
- All templates use structured YAML data with proper Liquid templating

**Template Features**:

- Automatic date sorting for news items
- Consistent CSS classes for styling
- Support for both content patterns (first_sentence and first_sentence_with_link)
- Proper template inheritance with `layout: default`

### 3. **Content Structure Conversion** - YAML Data Approach

**Brain Viewers Page** (`_pages/brain-viewers.md`):

- Converted from manual HTML to structured YAML
- All 8 items updated to use `first_sentence_with_link: true` (since links are first sentences)
- Used `content_list.liquid` layout

**Publications Page** (`_pages/publications.md`):

- Updated all 12 publications to use `first_sentence_with_link: true`
- Publication titles now bold linked "first sentences"
- Enhanced `publications.liquid` layout to handle the link pattern

**News System**:

- Updated all 11 news items in `_news/*.md` files to use structured approach
- Created comprehensive `/news/` page aggregating all news items chronologically
- Added separate `news.liquid` layout optimized for chronological content with dates
- Fixed image handling by moving images from content to front matter

**Tutorials/Learn Page** (`_pages/learn.md`):

- Updated both tutorial items to use `first_sentence_with_link: true`
- Changed navigation from "Tutorials" to "Learn"
- Changed first item title from "Voxelwise modeling" to "Voxelwise modeling tutorials"

**Code Page** (`_pages/opencode.md`):

- Updated all 4 code items to use `first_sentence_with_link: true`
- GitHub repository, Himalaya, Pycortex, CottonCandy all have bold linked titles

**Data Page** (`_pages/data.md`):

- Updated all 6 dataset items to use `first_sentence_with_link: true`
- All dataset names now bold clickable links to actual data repositories

### 4. **Navigation & Styling Enhancements**

**Navigation Updates**:

- Made active nav items bold: added `font-weight: bold;` to `.nav-link.active`
- Fixed news page linking: "News" header on about page already linked to `/news/`

**Alumni Updates**:

- Added Ben Willmore to alumni list with Oxford University profile link
- Moved `Ben.Willmore.webp` from root to `assets/img/people/`
- Proper bio format: "Dr. Willmore is now a Lecturer at Oxford University. (Web site [here](url).)"

### 5. **File Organization & Asset Management**

**Proper Jekyll Structure**:

- All images in `assets/img/people/`, `assets/img/papers/`, `assets/img/datasets/`
- Clean URL structure: `/news/`, `/publications/`, `/learn/`, `/data/`, `/opencode/`
- Structured data in `_data/people.yml` and YAML front matter
- No hardcoded HTML in content files

### Current Architecture Status - Maximally Jekyll Compliant!

✅ **Content as Data**: All content in structured YAML front matter  
✅ **Template Separation**: Clean separation between content, templates, and styling  
✅ **Consistent Patterns**: Unified approach across all sections  
✅ **No CSS Hacks**: Pure SCSS following existing patterns  
✅ **Proper Layouts**: Dedicated templates for different content types  
✅ **Asset Organization**: Clean file structure following Jekyll conventions  
✅ **URL Structure**: SEO-friendly permalinks and navigation

### Technical Implementation Details

**CSS Architecture**:

- Single `.first-sentence` class handles all bold first sentences
- Used existing SCSS variables and CSS custom properties
- No `!important` declarations or CSS overrides needed

**Template Logic**:

```liquid
{% if item.first_sentence_with_link %}
  <span class="first-sentence"
    ><a href="{{ item.url }}">{{ item.title }}</a>.</span
  >
  {{ item.remaining_description }}
{% elsif item.first_sentence %}
  <span class="first-sentence">{{ item.first_sentence }}</span> {{ item.remaining_description }}
{% else %}
  {{ item.content }}
{% endif %}
```

**Data Structure Pattern**:

```yaml
- title: "Item Title"
  url: "https://example.com"
  image: "/assets/img/category/item.webp"
  alt: "Alt text"
  first_sentence_with_link: true # OR first_sentence: "Text here."
  remaining_description: "Description continues here..."
```

### Files Modified/Created

### Next Session Priorities

- Test all functionality across the site
- Monitor any deployment issues
- Consider any final polish or additional content updates
- Verify all links and bold styling work correctly across all sections

## Current Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-29 (Eighth Session - Navigation Styling & Alumni Additions)
**Working Directory**: `/Users/gallant/LABADMIN/WEB/JEKYLL.7-25/working-gallant-site`

### Major Changes Made

### 1. **Active Navigation Styling Fix** - Jekyll Best Practices Approach

**Problem**: Active navigation items appeared as "black text on gray square" instead of bold blue styling.

**Root Cause**: CSS selector specificity issue with redundant `.navbar-light` classes causing conflicts with Bootstrap defaults.

**Solution**: Fixed using Jekyll-compliant CSS approach:

- Removed redundant selectors that caused double `.navbar-light .navbar-light` compilation
- Used proper CSS specificity: `.navbar-nav .nav-item.active .nav-link`
- Added proper SCSS nesting with `&:hover` and `&:focus` pseudo-selectors
- Utilized CSS custom properties: `var(--global-theme-color)`
- No `!important` declarations needed - clean cascade approach

**Implementation**:

```scss
// Active navigation styling - override Bootstrap defaults
.navbar-nav .nav-item.active .nav-link {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: var(--global-theme-color);
  background-color: transparent;

  &:hover,
  &:focus {
    font-weight: bold;
    color: var(--global-theme-color);
    background-color: transparent;
  }
}
```

### 2. **Alumni Additions with Image Processing** - 6 New Alumni Members

**Complete Alumni Addition Workflow**:

**Alexander Huth**:

- Converted `Alexander.Huth.jpg` to WebP format using ImageMagick
- Added to alumni: "Dr. Huth is now a Professor at UC Berkeley. (Lab web site [here](https://huthlab.github.io/).)"
- Title: "Former Postdoc" → Later corrected to "Former Neuroscience Graduate Student and Postdoc"

**James Mazer**:

- Converted `James.Mazer.jpg` to WebP format using ImageMagick
- Added to alumni: "After a long academic career as a Professor at Yale and MSU, Dr. Mazer has now moved to the technology industry."
- Title: "Former Postdoc"

**Kate Gustavsen**:

- Moved `Kate.Gustavsen.webp` from root to `assets/img/people/`
- Added to alumni: "Following her PhD, Dr. Gustavsen obtained her DVM and is now a veterinarian at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago."
- Title: "Former Graduate Student" → Later corrected to "Former Neuroscience Graduate Student"

**Ben Hayden**:

- Moved `Ben.Hayden.webp` from root to `assets/img/people/` (already WebP format)
- Added to alumni: "Dr. Hayden is now a Professor at Baylor University. (Lab web site [here](https://www.haydenlab.com/).)"
- Title: "Former Postdoc"

**Dustin Stansbury**:
